# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Resolve target repository → Detect environment → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
# Run project's test suite
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:**
```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]

Cannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.
```

Stop. Don't proceed to Step 2.

**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Resolve Target Repository and Detect Environment

**Before presenting options, resolve which repository this task is actually about.**

Use this priority order:
1. If the current task already names or clearly points to a repository, use that repository.
2. Otherwise, if the current directory is already inside a git repository, use that repository.
3. Otherwise, look for git repositories under the current directory.
4. If that discovery finds exactly one candidate, use it.
5. If the repository is still ambiguous or no candidate exists, ask the user which repository to use. Do not guess.

**All later git commands in this skill should run against that target repository, even if your session started from a parent directory.**

Once the target repository is known, determine workspace state before presenting options:

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git -C "$TARGET_REPO" rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git -C "$TARGET_REPO" rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
```

This determines which menu to show and how cleanup works:

| State | Menu | Cleanup |
|-------|------|---------|
| `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON` (normal repo) | Standard 4 options | No worktree to clean up |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, named branch | Standard 4 options | Provenance-based (see Step 6) |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, detached HEAD | Reduced 3 options (no merge) | No cleanup (externally managed) |

### Step 3: Determine Base Branch and Output Branch

Before presenting completion options, identify both branch roles explicitly:
- **Base branch:** the branch this work should merge back into
- **Output branch:** the branch that currently contains the implementation work

```bash
# Base branch guess aid
git -C "$TARGET_REPO" merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git -C "$TARGET_REPO" merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null

# Output branch
git -C "$TARGET_REPO" branch --show-current
```

If either branch is unclear, ask directly instead of guessing.

### Step 4: Present Options

**Normal repo and named-branch worktree — present exactly these 4 options:**

```
Implementation complete.
Base branch: <base-branch>
Output branch: <output-branch>

What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request from <output-branch>
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Detached HEAD — present exactly these 3 options:**

```
Implementation complete. You're on a detached HEAD (externally managed workspace).
Base branch: <base-branch>
Output branch: <output-branch>

1. Push as new branch and create a Pull Request
2. Keep as-is (I'll handle it later)
3. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Don't add explanation** - keep options concise.

### Step 5: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Merge Locally

```bash
# If the worktree still has uncommitted changes, commit them there first
git -C "$TARGET_REPO" status --short
git -C "$TARGET_REPO" add <files>
git -C "$TARGET_REPO" commit -m "<message>"

# Get main repo root for CWD safety
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$TARGET_REPO" -C "$(git -C "$TARGET_REPO" rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"

# Merge first — verify success before removing anything
git checkout <base-branch>
git pull
git merge <output-branch>
# Or cherry-pick specific commits if that's the intended integration shape

# Verify tests on merged result
<test command>

# Only after merge succeeds: cleanup worktree (Step 6), then delete branch
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 6), then delete branch:

```bash
git branch -d <output-branch>
```

#### Option 2: Push and Create PR

```bash
# Push branch
git push -u origin <output-branch>

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<2-3 bullets of what changed>

## Test Plan
- [ ] <verification steps>
EOF
)"
```

**Do NOT clean up worktree** — user needs it alive to iterate on PR feedback.

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping output branch <output-branch>. Worktree preserved at <path>."

**Don't cleanup worktree.**

#### Option 4: Discard

**Confirm first:**
```
This will permanently delete:
- Output branch <output-branch>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for exact confirmation.

If confirmed:
```bash
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$TARGET_REPO" -C "$(git -C "$TARGET_REPO" rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 6), then force-delete branch:
```bash
git branch -D <output-branch>
```

### Step 6: Cleanup Workspace

**Only runs for Options 1 and 4.** Options 2 and 3 always preserve the worktree.

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git -C "$TARGET_REPO" rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git -C "$TARGET_REPO" rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
WORKTREE_PATH=$(git -C "$TARGET_REPO" rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

**If `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON`:** Normal repo, no worktree to clean up. Done.

**If worktree path is under `.worktrees/`, `worktrees/`, or `~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/`:** Superpowers created this worktree — we own cleanup.

```bash
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$TARGET_REPO" -C "$(git -C "$TARGET_REPO" rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH"
git worktree prune  # Self-healing: clean up any stale registrations
```

**Otherwise:** The host environment (harness) owns this workspace. Do NOT remove it. If your platform provides a workspace-exit tool, use it. Otherwise, leave the workspace in place.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | yes | - | - | yes |
| 2. Create PR | - | yes | yes | - |
| 3. Keep as-is | - | - | yes | - |
| 4. Discard | - | - | - | yes (force) |

## Common Mistakes

**Assuming the open folder is the task repo**
- **Problem:** Parent folders can contain multiple repositories, so environment detection or cleanup runs against the wrong repo
- **Fix:** Resolve the target repository from task context first; if still ambiguous, ask the user

**Skipping test verification**
- **Problem:** Merge broken code, create failing PR
- **Fix:** Always verify tests before offering options

**Open-ended questions**
- **Problem:** "What should I do next?" is ambiguous
- **Fix:** Present exactly 4 structured options (or 3 for detached HEAD)

**Cleaning up worktree for Option 2**
- **Problem:** Remove worktree user needs for PR iteration
- **Fix:** Only cleanup for Options 1 and 4

**Deleting branch before removing worktree**
- **Problem:** `git branch -d` fails because worktree still references the branch
- **Fix:** Merge first, remove worktree, then delete branch

**Copying files out of the worktree instead of integrating the branch**
- **Problem:** Loses commit provenance, misses companion files, and makes rollback harder
- **Fix:** Commit in the worktree first, then merge or cherry-pick from the main checkout

**Running git worktree remove from inside the worktree**
- **Problem:** Command fails silently when CWD is inside the worktree being removed
- **Fix:** Always `cd` to main repo root before `git worktree remove`

**Cleaning up harness-owned worktrees**
- **Problem:** Removing a worktree the harness created causes phantom state
- **Fix:** Only clean up worktrees under `.worktrees/`, `worktrees/`, or `~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/`

**No confirmation for discard**
- **Problem:** Accidentally delete work
- **Fix:** Require typed "discard" confirmation

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Guess which repository the task means when context is still ambiguous
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request
- Remove a worktree before confirming merge success
- Clean up worktrees you didn't create (provenance check)
- Run `git worktree remove` from inside the worktree

**Always:**
- Verify tests before offering options
- Resolve the task's target repository before running git commands
- Ask the user if the target repository is still ambiguous
- Detect environment before presenting menu
- Present exactly 4 options (or 3 for detached HEAD)
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4
- Clean up worktree for Options 1 & 4 only
- `cd` to main repo root before worktree removal
- Run `git worktree prune` after removal
